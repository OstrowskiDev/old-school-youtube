## Overview

This repository holds Old School YouTube Firefox extension files.

Extension aims to hide non video content from YouTube's main page. Focusing mainly on Shorts Section and other content that normally can only be disabled temporarily. Thus giving back to the users ability to decide what content they want to see on YouTube's main page.

Extension focuses on YouTube's main page experience. You will be able to view shorts on their dedicated page, specific channel pages, and so on.

## Requirements

- Mozilla Firefox browser

## Downloads

You can [visit official Mozilla extensions website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/) to get the latest stable release for Firefox browser.

## Future features

I'm planning to add shorts removal from YouTube videos sub-pages. Apart from that, and updating existing functionality according to YouTube changes, nothing else is planned.
