## Overview

This repository holds Old School YouTube Firefox/Chrome extension files.

This extension aims to hide non video content from YouTube's pages. Focusing mainly on Shorts Section and other content that normally can only be disabled temporarily. Thus giving back to the users ability to decide what content they want to see on YouTube.

## Requirements

- Mozilla Firefox or Chrome browser

## Downloads

You can [visit official Mozilla extensions website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/) to get the latest stable release for Firefox browser.

## How to use

Just add this extension to your Firefox browser from Mozilla's official site:
- Go to Old School YouTube extension site [on Mozilla official site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/)
- Click "Add to Firefox" button
- Enjoy!

## Future features

I'm planning to add shorts removal from YouTube videos sub-pages. Apart from that, and updating existing functionality according to YouTube changes, nothing else is planned.
